What did you learn about pseudocode from working on this challenge?
it is very important to write it before you start writing the code. It gets to be much faster and clearer.

What are the tradeoffs of using arrays and hashes for this challenge?
arrays and hashes are very different. You can only use one or the other.

What does a method return?
it returns whatever you set it to return.

What kind of things can you pass into methods as arguments?
whatever you want to take into consideration as input, for the method to compute stuff using it.

How can you pass information between methods?
calling a method inside the other or naming global variables.

What concepts were solidified in this challenge, and what concepts are still confusing?
i think i m one step further in understanding how to build and code a method, and i don`t know what`s confusing... 
it`s like you don`t know what else can happen so you don`t know how to utter questions. :))
