What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
The semantic elements clearly define the context, whereas the non-semantic elements tell us nothing about its content. I like <img>, <a>.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
Unless there is some css instruction, it`s gonna display everything in the order they have been written.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
Sublime is a great tool and snippets are great shortcuts. I`ll definitely use snippets and create more snippets in the future.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can your understanding of this concept? 
It wasn`t difficult, but I liked that it intruduced the snippet subject, it was unexpected and i think it`s very helpful.-->
