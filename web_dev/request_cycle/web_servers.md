What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
-Unix was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things.(Doug Gwyn)
-An operating system, by its nature, embodies the philosophy of its creators... The creators of the Unix operating system started with a radical concept: they assumed that the user of their operating system would be computer literate from the start. The entire Unix philosophy revolves around the idea that the user knows what he or she is doing.(Mike Gancarz)
-It is flexible, for inexperienced and experienced users aswell.

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
A VPS hosting environment mimics a dedicated server within a shared hosting environment. It`s like a virtual box. These programs allow you to run several virtualized operating systems on one machine. For example, your desktop may be running Windows 7, but you can also run other operating systems such as Windows XP or Linux without needing to restart your computer.
Advantages: More stability and reliability for basic web hosting needs, More control compared to shared hosting, Easy scalability when needed, Cost effective solutions for small websites.

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
Because someone can easily hack your password, because you could enter the wrong key accidentally and would be unable to go back and maybe mess with your system`s ability to operate.
